## Transaction Lifecycle
Kollateral uses a simple pass-through architecture to enable flash loans, allowing developers to borrow-then-invoke through the protocol to their own contract. This allows any of the supported assets to be borrowed as long as they are paid back by the end of the invokable contract's method.

Kollateral handles aggregating liquidity from multiple flash-loan-enabled pools such as DyDx and Aave. As new pools come online, they will be added to the protocol ensuring that Kollateral always has the greatest available liquidity.

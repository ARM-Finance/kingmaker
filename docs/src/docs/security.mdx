# Security Considerations
Here we outline a few tips on interfacing with Kingmaker while minimizing trust in its correctness.

### Avoid storing funds in your invokable contract
Invokable contracts are safest when they do not store funds at rest. Ideally your contract will perform some atomic operation such as a liquidation or a refinance, and then transfer out any profit after repaying Kingmaker. In this situation the most likely *worst* case would be to lose the *profit* of one's atomic operation. All other cases should revert.

### Add a safeguard limit for Kingmaker's reward
Further, the `KingmakerInvokable` base class includes a `1%` emergency check, which will revert if the effective Kingmaker reward is in excess of this threshold. Adding your own redundant/more strict check could further increase safety.
